Learn GOLANG
This repository will serve as my place to learn the Golang. I will follow guides and other learning materials, but I will try to take the extra steps to improve on the resources I use so that I can learn.

Guides I Have/Will Follow
- [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)
- [Go By Expample](https://gobyexample.com)
Contributing
I don't know why you would contribute code (and I ask that you don't, this is for me to learn), but if you want to contribute, you can add guides you think I should use and/or project ideas below:
